Attempt: 

First, let's place Mae and the Reti Opening in the first game, since it is stated that Mae started (meaning, she is the first player).

Second, from the clue "The player who started with the Giuoco Start played 1 game after Luis", Luis cannot be the first player because no one can play before the first player. So, Luis should be the second player. Also, the Giuoco Start should be the gambit for the third game.

Third, the second clue states that the person who played second was either Tara or the person who started with the Evans Gambit. We know that the second player was Luis, so he must have used the Evans Gambit since Tara cannot be the second player.

Fourth, Rose must have played before the person who started with the Evans Gambit. So, Rose cannot be the third or fourth player. Also, as Mae is the first player, Rose must play the second game. However, Luis is the second player, so Rose is Luis. This leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem. Please check and ensure all clues are correct.
