Attempt: 

Let's understand the problem: 

We have four tortoises with different names, species and ages. We are given certain clues. We have to match each tortoise with its corresponding species and age.

Plan: Let's break down the statements in the problem and deduce the solution from there.

Clue 1: The four animals are the 14-year-old tortoise, the pitch belly tortoise, the black neck tortoise and Methuselah. 
- This means that Methuselah can't be 14 years old, nor can it be a pitch belly tortoise or a black neck tortoise. 

Clue 2: Of the 32-year-old one and the two-rimmed tortoise, one is named Methuselah and the other is named Yoda.
- This means that Methuselah is either a 32-year-old tortoise or a two rimmed tortoise. But based on Clue 1, since Methuselah can't be 14 years old, it must be 32 years old. Therefore, Yoda must be the two-rimmed tortoise.

Clue 3: Toredo is 36 years younger than the pitch belly tortoise.
- 36 years younger than 32-year-old (the oldest possible if we consider the maximum age to be 68) is -4 which is impossible. 36 years younger than 50-year-old pitch belly would be 14 which is possible. 36 years younger than 68-year-old pitch belly would be 32 years old, but Methuselah is 32 years old. Therefore, the pitch belly must be 50 years old and Toredo must be 14 years old. 

Now we can solve the following relationships:

Methuselah is the 32 year old swoop-backed tortoise (14-year-old is Toredo, pitch belly tortoise is 50 years old and Yoda is the two-rimmed tortoise).
Shelly is the 68-year-old black neck tortoise (she can't be 14-year-old (that's Toredo), 32-year-old (that's Methuselah), or the two-rimmed tortoise (that's Yoda).
Yoda is a 14-year-old two-rimmed tortoise (Yoda can't be swoop-backed (that's Methuselah), black necked (that's Shelly), or 50-year-old (that's pitch belly), so he must be 14 years old).
Toredo is the remaining 14-year-old pitch belly tortoise.

Final answer:

Methuselah: 32 years old, Swoop-backed
Shelly: 68 years old, Black neck
Toredo:14 years old, Pitch belly
Yoda: 50 years old, Two rimmed
