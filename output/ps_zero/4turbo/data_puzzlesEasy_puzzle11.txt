Attempt: 

:
- Mt. Dawson (14340 feet) - not summited by Hal (Norman) or Gerry (Ingram) or Kermit (shorter than 14600), so Irving Igor.
- Mt. Ingram (14600 feet) - Gerry Gamble
- Mt. Larsen (14210 feet) - Irving Igor-contracting (fix Igor to the leftover climber, re-set as Hal Hudson).
- Mt. Norman (14470 feet) - Hal Hudson.
Thus Mt. Larsen = 14210 - Kermit Kramer due to the leftover assignment.

Grade:
