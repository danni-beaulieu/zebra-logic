Attempt: 

:
- Mt. Dawson: 14340, Climber: Unknown
- Mt. Norman: 14470, Climber: Unknown (Adjusted for clarity)
- Mt. Ingram: 14600, Climber: Gerry Gamble
- Mt. Larsen: 14210, Climber: Irving Igor
- Mount climbed first by Kermit Kramer: not accurately determinable with the information available for heights, suggesting possible mistakes in my initial height allocations. 
Correct this considering Kermit's and other strict height relationships. Kermit essentially summited whatever was left unassigned excluding Dawson and possibly higher than Ingram in actual definitive sense. 
Kermit, therefore, summited the unassigned height which must be logically fit to conclude who climbed which mountain.
