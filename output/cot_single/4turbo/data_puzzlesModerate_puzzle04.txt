Attempt: 

:
- Pablo, Peru, 3:30 pm (Pablo's direct connection (clue 4) and considering 3:30 pm in options of clue 3)
- Terrance, Jamaica, 4:30 pm (since Jamaica should be either at 3:30 pm or 4:30 pm as per clue 3, and Pablo takes 3:30 pm)
- Claude, Malta, 5:30 pm (from the timing derivation and elimination of other options)
- Jeanne, Qatar, 4:30 pm (matching the remaining options left for Qatar, an hour later than Terrance) 

(Note: This answer could be re-evaluated with slight adjustments in understanding or deducing timings if any logical inconsistency is later identified. The correct association needs careful timing alignment as per the clues given.)
