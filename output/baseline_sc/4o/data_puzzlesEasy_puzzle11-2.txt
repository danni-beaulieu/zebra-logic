To solve the logic grid puzzle, let's use the given clues step-by-step:

1. We know Mt. Norman is 14470 feet tall.
2. Kermit Kramer's mountain is taller than Mt. Dawson and shorter than Mt. Ingram.
3. Mt. Dawson is 260 feet shorter than the mountain Kermit first summited.
4. Mt. Ingram was first climbed by Gerry Gamble.
5. The 14210 feet mountain is either Mt. Larsen or the one Irving Igor first summited.

Now let's find more relations and focus on identifying each element.

- Start with the known mountain, Mt. Norman = 14470 feet.

Let's analyze:
- The mountain first summited by Kermit Kramer is the mountain taller than Mt. Dawson but shorter than Mt. Ingram. This means: 
  - Mt. Dawson = 14470 - 260 = 14210.
  - Therefore, Kermit's mountain = Mt. Norman with 14470 feet.
  
Mt. Norman (14470) is confirmed as Kermit's mountain.
- From this, Mt. Dawson is confirmed to be 14210 feet.

Next, we look at:
- Mt. Dawson is 14210 feet.
- The peak that is 14210 feet tall is either Mt. Larsen or the one first summited by Irving Igor.
  
Since Mt. Dawson = 14210, and Mt. Norman was Kermit's peak, the 14210-ft peak summited by Irving is not possible; hence, it must be Mt. Larsen.

Now letâ€™s solve for the remaining elements:
- Mt. Ingram was first climbed by Gerry Gamble. Mt. Norman was summited by Kermit. That leaves:
  - Mt. Larsen = 14210 was summited by Irving Igor.
  
Thus, the last mountain without a climber, which is Mt. Ingram, must be first climbed by Gerr Gamble and its height fits the sequence as the next height is 14600.

Now we can organize the data:
- Mt. Dawson = 14210 feet (summited by Irving Igor)
- Mt. Larsen = 14340 feet (not assigned yet)
- Mt. Norman = 14470 feet (summited by Kermit Kramer)
- Mt. Ingram = 14600 feet (summited by Gerry Gamble)

Now, handing out the remaining unassigned mountain and summiter:
- So, 14600 must be Gerry's, means other heights and summits fit sequentially.

Final assignment:
- The last remaining one links to summits:
  - Hal Hudson's Mountain is the remaining one (Mt. Larsen), since Gerry, Irving, and Kermit are all assigned their mountains.

Thus:
- Mt. Dawson - 14210 feet - Irving Igor
- Mt. Larsen - 14340 feet - Hal Hudson
- Mt. Norman - 14470 feet - Kermit Kramer
- Mt. Ingram - 14600 feet - Gerry Gamble

The final answer is organized thus:

Mt. Dawson, 14210, Irving Igor  
Mt. Larsen, 14340, Hal Hudson  
Mt. Norman, 14470, Kermit Kramer  
Mt. Ingram, 14600, Gerry Gamble
