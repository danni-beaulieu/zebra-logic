Attempt: 

 for the second logic grid puzzle:
   
1. Mrs. Massey's cake, delivered on October 8, must be in the shape of a sailboat, following the clues.
2. Mrs. Becker's cake is delivered the day after a cake shaped like a rocket ship implies rocket ship delivery dates are October 5, 6, or 7, and Mrs. Becker’s cake dates are October 6, 7, or 8. Since Mrs. Massey has October 8 booked, Mrs. Becker can only have her cake delivered on October 7.
3. This makes the rocket ship shape for October 6 because Mrs. Becker can’t have the October 8 sailboat or her delivery on October 8.
4. As Mrs. Massey's sailboat is set for October 8, and the rocket ship is dated October 6, the remaining October 5 must be for the shape delivered before Mrs. Keller, which is the bowling pin.
5. Last shape turtle is either Mrs. Becker or Mrs. Massey. Since Mrs. Massey has the sailboat, the turtle must be Mrs. Becker’s cake.
6. The last remaining customer, Ingram, gets the rocket ship cake on October 6.

Final Resolution:
- October 8: Massey, sailboat
- October 7: Becker, turtle
- October 6: Ingram, rocket ship
- October 5: Keller, bowling pin
