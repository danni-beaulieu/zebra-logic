First puzzle analysis:

1. The Pinkster pack is 5 liters smaller than the Grennel pack.
2. Olga's pack is 25 liters.
3. The 30 liter pack, the Bistric pack, and the Grennel pack are all different packs.
4. Of Leroy's pack and the Travelore pack, one is 25 liters and the other is 30 liters.
5. Gene's pack is 35 liters.

Let's map it out:
- Since Olga has the 25 liters pack and the Travelore pack is 25 or 30 liters, Leroy must have the 30 liters one (as per clue 4 since Olga can't also have Travelore). Therefore, Leroy's pack is the Travelore at 30 liters or the other type. But if Olga has 25 liters, then Leroy cannot have Travelore if that’s 25. Leroy must be 30 liters, Travelore, or Olga must be Travelore leading Leroy to be 25 liters different.
- Thus, only two pack sizes remain: 35 liters and 40 liters. Gene has 35 liters, leaving 40 liters for Jeffrey.
- That means Gene's pack cannot be Bistric or Grennel (since they can’t be 35 liters as per clue 3).
- Since Pinkster is 5 liters smaller than Grennel, then Grennel must be 35 liters (as it’s the only size left that would allow another pack to be smaller by exactly 5 liters). So Gene has the Grennel pack.
- Pinkster then must be 30 liters. Leroy has the 30 liters pack, so he has Pinkster.
- Only Olga and Jeffrey’s brands are left. With Olga at 25 liters and knowing that the Bistric pack isn't 25 liters, Olga must have Travelore. Jeffrey thus has Bistric, and it must be 40 liters.

Final mapping:
- Olga, Travelore, 25
- Leroy, Pinkster, 30
- Gene, Grennel, 35
- Jeffrey, Bistric, 40

Second puzzle analysis:

1. Luther scored 49 points.
2. Bertha is either the person who scored 56 points or the person who made the smoked pork.
3. Hattie scored 7 fewer points than the person who made the turkey soup.
4. The chef who scored 42 points made the cashew tofu.
5. The person who made the cajun chili scored 7 fewer points than Bertha.

Set the stage:
- Scores are 42, 49, 56, 63. Luther has 49, someone has 42 (hence cashew), and someone else +7 from Bertha.
- Since Hattie scored 7 fewer than turkey soup, turkey soup can't be 42 or 49, hence must be 56, making Hattie 49 - not possible as Luther is 49. Turkey soup must thus be 63, making Hattie 56.
- This means, Bertha has to be the one with the smoked pork because the only other score left for her isn’t associated with smoked pork.
- Since turkey soup is 63, and cajun chili scores 7 less than Bertha, if Bertha has 56, then cajun chili is 49. Luther made the cajun chili.
- Wade then must be associated with turkey soup, leaving cashew tofu for the remaining chef with 42 points.

So the final answer:
- Luther: cajun chili, 49 points
- Wade: turkey soup, 63 points
- Bertha: smoked pork, 56 points
- Hattie: cashew tofu, 42 points

This solution reconciles all provided clues properly.
