To solve the logic grid puzzle for the entities and clues provided about the hedge funds, their returns, and their managers:

1. First Crescent is run by Kip Kerr.

   From this information directly:
   - First Crescent → Kip Kerr

2. Citizen Trust is either the one with a return of 7% or the fund run by Kip Kerr.

   But since Kip Kerr runs First Crescent, Citizen Trust must have a return of 7%.
   - Citizen Trust → 7%
   - This also implies Walter Wade manages Citizen Trust (From clue 4).

3. The fund run by Ule Underwood has a 2 percent larger return than Hudson Brook.

   We will specify the exact returns after evaluating the remaining clues.

4. The fund with a return of 7% is run by Walter Wade.

   Already used to identify that Walter Wade manages Citizen Trust, confirming Citizen Trust → 7%, Walter Wade.
   
   Remaining managers and their funds:
   - Kip Kerr → First Crescent
   - Ule Underwood
   - Mike McClain
   - Remaining funds:
   - Hudson Brook
   - Oak Capital

   The funds' returns left to assign:
   - 6%, 8%, 9%

   Since Ule Underwood's fund has a 2 percent larger return than Hudson Brook, let's find a combination that fits:
   - If Hudson Brook → 6%, then Ule Underwood's fund → 8% (6% + 2%)
   - This leaves the 9% return to the remaining fund and manager.

5. Fill in the remaining hedging:
   - Hudson Brook → 6%
   - Mike McClain then must run Oak Capital with a 9% return because the remaining pairing options are exhausted.
   - Ule Underwood → 8%
   - First Crescent is the only remaining fund without a return assigned. Returns for First Crescent cannot be 6%, 7%, or 8%, so it must be 9%.
   - This leaves Kip Kerr having the fund of 9% instead, thus adjusting Mike McClain must be with Hudson Brook with 6%.
   - Ule Underwood runs Oak Capital with 8%.

Final solution:
- Citizen Trust, 7%, Walter Wade
- Hudson Brook, 6%, Mike McClain
- Oak Capital, 8%, Ule Underwood
- First Crescent, 9%, Kip Kerr
