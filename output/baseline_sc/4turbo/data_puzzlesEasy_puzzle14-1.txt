For the second logic grid puzzle regarding distances, planets, and stars:

**Clue Analysis and Deductions:**

1. **"Istryn, the exoplanet orbiting HV 491, and the planet orbiting PLC 120 are all different planets."**
   Istryn ≠ HV 491, Istryn ≠ PLC 120.

2. **"Vestor is either 47 light years or orbits BDF 198. Vestor orbits HV 491."**
   Vestor = HV 491.
   As Vestor ≠ 47 light years from clue 2 above, Vestor has a different distance, Vestor ≠ BDF 198.

3. **"Istryn is closer than the planet orbiting MKP 427."**
   If MKP 427 = x light years, Istryn < MKP 427.

4. **"The exoplanet orbiting PLC 120 is 2 light years closer to us than Rodul."**
   PLC 120 = y - 2 light years, Rodul = y.

**Incomplete due to missing precise distance connections and remaining clues**, requiring further analysis of distances.
