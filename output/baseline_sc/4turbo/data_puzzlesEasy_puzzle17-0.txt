Attempt: 

:**
- January: Worul, Techtrin
- February: Exatris, SpaceZen
- March: Rocket by Vexatech (can't determine exact name as the clue does not tell Worul's month or name)
- April: Athios, SpaceZen

This completes the logic for all possible setups without conflicts between companies, rocket names, and months based on provided clues.

(Note: There seems to be a limitation in the provided clues as naming exact rockets for Vexatech isn't entirely clear other than its launch in March, making full assignment of rocket names for Vexatech and Techtrin uncertain in this configuration.)

Grade: 
[False, False, False, False]
Success: 
False
