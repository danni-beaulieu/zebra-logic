Attempt: 

:
- Midge Mintz, alfalfa, $5.50
- Linda Lynn, nectar unknown, $8.50
- Keith Koch, sage, $7.50
- Jim Joyner, sourwood, $6.50

Note: Linda Lynn's nectar isn't explicitly provided but it logically can't be sage, alfalfa, or sourwood, thus it must be lemon blossom. Hence, the complete answer would be:
- Midge Mintz, alfalfa, $5.50
- Linda Lynn, lemon blossom, $8.50
- Keith Koch, sage, $7.50
- Jim Joyner, sourwood, $6.50
