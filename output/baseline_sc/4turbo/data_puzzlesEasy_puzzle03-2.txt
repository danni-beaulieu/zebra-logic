Let's solve the second logic grid puzzle using provided clues:

Entities:
- Fares: $6.50, $9.50, $12.50, $15.50
- Customers: Allen, Kate, Max, Vera
- Pickup points: Arctic Building, Camlin Hotel, Moore Mansion, Space Needle

Clues:
1. Vera was picked up at the Moore Mansion.
2. The customer who got picked up at the Space Needle paid $6 less than the client who got picked up at the Arctic Building.
3. The person who got picked up at the Space Needle paid $3 more than Kate.
4. Max paid $15.50.

Step by step analysis:
- We know Vera was picked up at Moore Mansion (Clue 1).
- Max paid $15.50 (Clue 4). He did not necessarily to be picked up at Moore Mansion; rather, it only tells his fare.

Identifying other fares and locations:
- The customer from the Space Needle paid $6 less than from the Arctic Building (Clue 2).
- The person from the Space Needle paid $3 more than Kate (Clue 3).

We need to find the correct fare values for the Space Needle and Arctic Building using clues 2 and 3 in conjunction:
Since we know the fares list, letâ€™s test possible values:
- If Space Needle = $9.50, Arctic Building = $15.50 (the max fare and also $6.50 difference).
- Which means, Kate paid $6.50 (Space Needle - $3 = $6.50).

Distributing remaining fare and locations:
- Vera (Moore Mansion) cannot pay $15.50 since Max paid this fare. We also know Kate paid $6.50. Remaining fares for Vera are either $9.50 or $12.50.
- Max thus is not Moore Mansion or Space Needle, as their fares were $9.50 and $6.50, both wrong for his $15.50 fare. Max was picked at Arctic Building. 
- Remaining Location for Kate (who paid $6.50) is Camlin Hotel.

Let's summarize the information:
- Max (Arctic Building, $15.50),
- Kate (Camlin Hotel, $6.50),
- Vera (Moore Mansion, $9.50) as the only left valid combination based on Clue 1.
- Thereby, remaining one is Allen at Space Needle, paying $9.50.

Final solution:
- Allen, Space Needle, $9.50
- Kate, Camlin Hotel, $6.50
- Max, Arctic Building, $15.50
- Vera, Moore Mansion, $12.50 

This aligns with all given clues and distributes fares uniquely for all customers and pickup points without contradictions.
