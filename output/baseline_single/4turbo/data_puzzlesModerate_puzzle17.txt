Attempt: 

First, let's solve the logic grid puzzle about the backpacks:

1. Olga's pack is 25 liters.
2. The Pinkster pack is 5 liters smaller than the Grennel pack.
3. The 30 liter pack, the Bistric pack, and the Grennel pack are all different packs.
4. Of Leroy's pack and the Travelore pack, one is 25 liters and the other is 30 liters.
5. Gene's pack is 35 liters.

Given these clues:
- We know Olga's pack is 25 liters. Since the Travelore pack is either 25 or 30 liters and Leroy's pack is either 25 or 30 liters, and Olga doesn't match either of these criteria because one must be 30 liters, Olga cannot have the Travelore pack. Therefore, Leroy's pack is 30 liters and the Travelore pack is 25 liters (associated with Olga).
- Gene's pack being 35 liters can only leave the Grennel pack either 35 or 40 liters. The Pinkster pack, being 5 liters smaller than the Grennel pack, would be either 30 or 35 liters. Since Leroy took the 30-liter Pinkster pack, the Grennel pack is 35 liters (for Gene).
- Consistently, the remaining 40 liters must be associated with the Bistric pack, which is for Jeffrey.

Final solution:
- Olga, Travelore, 25 liters
- Leroy, Pinkster, 30 liters
- Gene, Grennel, 35 liters
- Jeffrey, Bistric, 40 liters

Next, let's solve the logic grid puzzle about the chess players:

1. Mae started with the Reti Opening.
2. The player who started with the Giuoco Start played 1 game after Luis.
3. The person who played second was either Tara or the person who started with the Evans Gambit.
4. Rose played 1 game before the person who started with the Evans Gambit.

Given these clues:
- Mae started with the Reti Opening, making her the first player.
- Since Rose played one game before the person with the Evans Gambit and Rose did not do the first match (Mae did), Rose must be in the third position playing in the second match. Therefore, Evans Gambit was in the fourth match.
- The person who played the second match (from the third clue) was either Tara or the player with the Evans Gambit. But since Evans Gambit was fourth, Tara played the second match.
- Since the player who used the Giuoco Start played one game after Luis, and Luis did not play in the first or second matches (they were Mae and Tara), Luis played third using the Giuoco Start. The last remaining game (fourth) used the Evans Gambit.

Final solution:
1. Mae, Reti Opening, first
2. Tara, Torre Attack, second
3. Luis, Giuoco Start, third
4. Rose, Evans Gambit, fourth
