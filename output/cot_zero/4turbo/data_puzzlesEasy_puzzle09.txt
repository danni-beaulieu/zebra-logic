Attempt: 

:**
- Dog: **Jake**, Trainer: **Teresa**, Weeks: **8**
- Dog: **Gizmo**, Trainer: **Stephanie**, Weeks: **7**
- Dog: **Buster**, Weeks: **8**, (Trainer can't be Martha, Odette, or Teresa so must be the last person Stephanie, but it was Teresa who took Jake so adjust it)
- Dog: Buster, Trainer: **Martha** (As Jake took up Teresa's slot, and Buster couldnâ€™t be trained by Odette as she trained the 6 weeks dog.)
- Dog: **Bailey**, Trainer: **Odette**, Weeks: **6**
- Dog: **Buster**, Trainer: **Stephanie**, Weeks: **8**
- Dog Assigned to **Martha**: the **9 weeks** dog. The remaining dog not assigned is Gizmo, so Martha trains Gizmo for **9 weeks**.
