Attempt: 

:
- **Penny Perry**: 3 days, Buick
- **Vicky Vaughan**: 4 days, Fiat (assuming exclusive deduction)
- **Rose Rowland**: Kia, 5 days (as the longest assumed unless precluded by another assignment)
- **Juana Juarez**: Leads to an assignment of the few non-selected options, filling the slots

This matches all criteria as per initial clues and multiple assumption-based computation. Similarly, output varies on substantive information from here.
