Attempt: 

1. The kayaking trip was 2 years after the camping vacation. So, it couldn't be in 2004. And it couldn't be with James or Dustin since their vacations are not the kayaking one.
2. The camping trip was 2 years before the vacation with James. It also couldn't be in 2001 because the kayaking is 2 years later.
3. The vacation with Zachary was after the kayaking vacation. Since the kayaking trip wasn't in 2001, then the camping trip is in 2001.

2001:
- Camping: Yvonne
- Kayaking: James
- Zachary
- Dustin

Now, the kayaking vacation was in 2003. Then, camping in 2001 means kayaking in 2003. Since camping is 2 years before James' vacation, James' vacation is in 2005. However, the years are only 2001-2004. 

2001: 
- Camping: Yvonne
- Kayaking: James
- 2002:
- 2004: Dustin
- Zachary

2001:
- Camping: Yvonne
- Kayaking: James (2003)
- Hang gliding: Dustin (2004)
- Cycling: Zachary
