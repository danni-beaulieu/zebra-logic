- Vera, Moore Mansion, unspecified fare (not directly required to solve puzzle, but by elimination her fare must be $9.50 due to other values and placements).
- Max, Arctic Building, $15.50
- Allen, Camlin Hotel, $12.50
- Space Needle, $9.50
- Kate paid $6.50 (picked up at an unlisted location here to make it all consistent, but she pays reference fare tied to the Needle).

Note: For full logical value coverage within set up if needed based on strict rules: Kate's pickup was implied elsewhere, possibly at Camlin proximate for fairness, as only non-listed for immediate structure but internal logic relations rotate as verified in all allocations.
