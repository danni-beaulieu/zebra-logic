Attempt: 


- **January:** (Hosted by Lynette) Rules of War  
- **February:** Vendetta
- **March:** Bladescape
- **April:** Planets Align (Hosted by remaining Ira or Yolanda if not otherwise specified)  

Host associations align as:

- **Ira:** Ira must host the April game if not linked elsewhere.
- **Lynette:** January game.
- **Yolanda:** Hosts one of the games, likely either Vendetta or Planets Align; by fitting the unsettled associations. In this resolution, Yolanda can be aligned with the adjacent logic.
- The host Yolanda is linked accordingly only if other configurations are exhausted logically.

Using deduction, reasoning, matching, and process of elimination, one arrives at these conclusions as the most fitting.
