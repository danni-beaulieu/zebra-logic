Steps:

Extract information from each clue.

1. "Greg finished 2 minutes before the contestant in the maroon shirt."
- Greg's time could be either 21, 22 or 23 minutes.
- The time of the contestant in the maroon shirt could be either 23, 24 minutes or absent because no participant can complete above 24.

2. "The competitor who finished in 24 minutes wore the orange shirt."
- The orange shirt wearer's time is 24 minutes.
- The time of 24 minutes cannot be associated with Greg or the maroon shirt because Greg's time must be less than the time of the maroon shirt.

3. "The contestant in the violet shirt finished 1 minute before Kelly."
- The violet shirt wearer's time could be 21, 22 or 23 minutes.
- Kelly's time could be 22, 23 or 24 minutes.
- Kelly's time equals the time of the violet shirt contestant plus 1 minute.

4. "Herman finished 1 minute before Patrick."
- Herman's time could be either 21, 22 or 23 minutes.
- Patrick's time could be 22, 23, or 24 minutes.
- Patrick's time equals Herman's time plus 1 minute.

Combine information from multiple clues.

From clue 4, Patrick can't finish in 22 minutes because that would mean Herman finished in 21 minutes. Combining this with clue 3, since Kelly can finish in 22 minutes without contradicting any clue, we know Kelly finished in 22 minutes. With this information, the contestant in the violet shirt finished in 21 minutes. This leads to Greg finishing in 23 minutes and the contestant in the maroon shirt finishing in absent time raising contradictions. 

This indicates that there is an error in the given clues. The logic grid puzzle is unsolvable with the provided information.
