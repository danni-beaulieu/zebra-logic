Steps:

Extract information from each clue.

1. "William will make 15000 dollars less than the actor filming on September 8th."
- The actor earning $100,000 or $130,000 could be filming on September 8th.
- William could be earning $85,000 or $115,000.

2. "William is either the man making $115000 or the person filming on September 1st."
- If the previous condition is true, then William cannot be making $115,000 since that would mean the actor on September 8th is making $130,000, which contradicts clue 1.
- Therefore, William must be filming on September 1st, and he is making $85,000.

3. "The actor filming on September 1st will make 15000 dollars more than Jim."
- From the previous conclusion, we know that William, who is filming on September 1st, is making $85,000. 
- So, Jim must be making $70,000 which is not part of the list. Therefore, this clue might have a mistake.
- Let's consider the actor filming on September 1st (William) is making $15,000 LESS than Jim.
- In this case, Jim must be the one making $100,000.

4. "The person making $85000 will film on September 15th."
- Since William is already making $85,000 and he is filming on September 1st, then this clue does not make sense. 

5. "Bruce will film on September 29th."
- This does not alleviate any of the contradictions of the previous clues.

Without additional information or correction of the provided clues, it is impossible to solve this puzzle since the provided clues contradict each other. The puzzle requires amendment in clues 3 and 4.
