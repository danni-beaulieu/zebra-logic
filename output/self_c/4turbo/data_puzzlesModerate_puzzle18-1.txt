**Step-by-step reasoning using clues:** 

**First Puzzle:**

1. **Clue 1**: The Pinkster pack is 5 liters smaller than the Grennel pack.
   - Pinkster = Grennel - 5 liters.

2. **Clue 2**: Olga's pack is 25 liters.

3. **Clue 3**: The 30 liter pack, the Bistric pack, and the Grennel pack are all different packs. 
   - Bistric ≠ 30 liters; Grennel ≠ 30 liters.

4. **Clue 4**: Of Leroy's pack and the Travelore pack, one is 25 liters and the other is 30 liters.

5. **Clue 5**: Gene's pack is 35 liters.

Starting from clues 2 and 5:
- Olga = 25 liters, Gene = 35 liters.

Following Clue 3:
- Bistric ≠ 30 liters; Grennel ≠ 30 liters; only Pinkster could be 30 liters or 25 liters remains feasible for Leroy or the Travelore pack, knowing Olga's initial option.

Applying Clue 4:
- With Olga having 25 liters, Leroy must have 30 liters. Travelore must then be 25 liters.

Using Clue 1 (and remaining sizes):
- If Pinkster is 30 liters (as options are now narrowing due to Clue 4), Grennel must be 35 liters (Gene's).
- This places Jeffrey with the only leftover size and brand: Bistric, 40 liters.

**Final Solution:**
- Olga, Travelore, 25 liters
- Leroy, Pinkster, 30 liters 
- Gene,  Grennel, 35 liters
- Jeffrey, Bistric, 40 liters

**Second Puzzle:**
1. **Clue 1**: Charlie will start sometime after the person who will be working with Nelson.
   - Charlie’s time > Nelson’s interpreter's time.

2. **Clue 2**: Of the person whose assignment begins at 10:00am and Frederick, one will be working with Nelson and the other will be working with Orlando.
   - If 10:00am interpreter works with Nelson, Frederick works with Orlando, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3**: The interpreter whose assignment begins at 11:00am is either Ira or the interpreter who will be working with Karla.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who will be working with Nelson will start 1 hour after Ira.
   - Indicates Nelson's interpreter starts at either 10:00am or 12:00pm if Ira starts at 9:00am or 11:00am respectively.

With Clue 4:
- Place Ira at 9:00am or 11:00am.

Using Clue 2:
- If Ira was 11:00am, 10:00am slot is free for Nelson's interpreter and consequently, Frederick at 10:00am with either Nelson or Orlando.

Revisit Clue 3:
- Given Ira starts at 11:00am, it refines who can start at 10:00am with Nelson.

Combine Clue 1:
- Charlie must start after this which confirms Ira ≠ Nelson's and Charlie's time.

Accurately fixing:
- Nelson’s interpreter is 10:00am (post Ira at 9:00am), confirming Frederick works with Orlando.
- Charlie's start time constraint and Clue 2 implicate Charlie later than 10:00am but before 12:00pm given remaining slots.
