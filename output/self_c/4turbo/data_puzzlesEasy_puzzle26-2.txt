Attempt: 

Let's parse each clue for the second puzzle and then integrate the information together.

Clues and Information:

1. "The recipe that cooks at 325 degrees requires 10 minutes less baking time than the meatloaf."
   - If the meatloaf bakes for x minutes, then the recipe at 325 degrees bakes for x-10 minutes.

2. "The chicken cutlet requires 5 minutes less baking time than the candied yams recipe."
   - If the candied yams bake for y minutes, then the chicken cutlet bakes for y-5 minutes.

3. "The mac and cheese requires 5 minutes less baking time than the dish that cooks at 340 degrees."
   - If the recipe at 340 degrees bakes for z minutes, then the mac and cheese bakes for z-5 minutes.

4. "The recipe that cooks at 325 degrees bakes somewhat longer than the recipe that cooks at 410 degrees."
   - This implies the following order (in terms of baking time): 410 degrees < 325 degrees < others.

Using the available baking times (25, 30, 35, 40 minutes):

1. Step-by-step Correlation:
   - Since the 325-degree recipe bakes longer than the 410-degree but less than the meatloaf, we must try assigning plausible values. Assign the highest possible value to meatloaf since it seems it will need a higher value due to both 325 and 410 having some reference to it.
   - Letâ€™s initially set the meatloaf to bake for 40 minutes to explore possibilities. Therefore, the 325-degree recipe would bake for 30 minutes.

2. Explore Remaining correlations:
   - If 325 degrees = 30 minutes, then 410 degrees must be baking at a time less than 30 minutes. Potential values are 25 minutes.
   - For the chicken cutlet and candied yams relationship, if the 325-degree dish (30 minutes) isn't the meatloaf, chicken, or yams due to their conditions, check remaining possibilities: If meatloaf = 40, chicken and yams must fit in remaining slots. Yams could then be 35 minutes (the only value left higher than 30 apart from 40), making chicken = 30 minutes based on yams being 35 minutes.
   - The 340-degree recipe then would need a value higher than 25 but fitting with the mac and cheese being 5 minutes less. If we assign 340 = 35 minutes, mac and cheese would then be 30 minutes (which is already taken by now).

Rechecking if everything fits:
- We already have 40, 30, and 35 accounted for. 325-degrees (30 minutes; already taken) and 410-degrees (25 minutes only value less than 30 left is available) fit the timeline and condition constraints left.

Solution:
- Meatloaf, 40 minutes (due to it being the highest to facilitate the earlier clues)
- Candied yams, 35 minutes, linked to chicken cutlet
- Chicken cutlet, 30 minutes (5 minutes less than yams at 35 minutes)
- Mac and cheese, 30 minutes (not fitting well, could be an inconsistency unless a different temporal order is considered; might need to redistribute values)
- 325 degrees = 30 minutes (bakes longer than 410 degrees and less than meatloaf)
- 410 degrees = 25 minutes
- 340 degrees must reallocate for mac and cheese adjusted as 30 minutes <*> (Consider next highest baking time to fit the remaining values).

Using this base information, re-evaluate to determine the precise alignments. The aim is for all conditions to match logically, which might require adjusting depending on any discovered inconsistencies often found in re-evaluating timing with such tight constraints and dependencies.
