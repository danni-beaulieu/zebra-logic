Attempt: 

To solve the second logic grid puzzle, analyze and synthesize the clues provided:

1. "The ostrich that finished second was #128."
   - #128 finishes second.

2. "Ophelia finished second."
   - Ophelia is #128 since both finished second.

3. "The ostrich that finished first was either #118 or #126."
   - First is occupied by either #118 or #126.

4. "The runner that finished third was either #126 or Bridget."
   - Third is either #126 or Bridget.

5. "Stretch finished 2 places after Kermit."
   - Stretch is two places behind Kermit.

Analyzing the clues altogether:

- Ophelia is #128 and finishes second.
- Since the third position is either #126 or Bridget, and Stretch finishes two places after Kermit:
  - If Kermit finishes first or second, then Stretch would be third or fourth.
  - But if Kermit were first, Stretch should ideally be third, yet this is not possible because third is either Bridget or #126.
  - Thus, if Kermit finishes third, it allows Stretch to finish fourth. But then both first and second should not be him, so Kermit can’t be first.
  - Kermit cannot finish third because third is for #126 or Bridget.
  - Hence, Kermit must be first. Stretch, therefore, will finish fourth.
  - Since Kermit is first and Ophelia (as #128) is second, then either #118 or #126 takes the first. If First was #126, third would be #118, leaving Bridget not fitting as #118 isn’t an option for third. Therefore, #118 is first (and is Kermit), #126 is third, and Bridget is also third.
  
Final answer:
- Kermit, #118, first.
- Ophelia, #128, second.
- Bridget, #126, third.
- Stretch, fourth.
