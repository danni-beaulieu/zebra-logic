Attempt: 

From the problem statement and clues, let's work through each clue one by one:

1. **Fred Fleming began 1 year before Ned Nielsen.**
   - If Ned started in 2008, then Fred must have started in 2007.
   - If Ned started in 2009, then Fred must have started in 2008.
   - If Ned started in 2010, then Fred must have started in 2009.

2. **"Prism Shield" began 2 years before Edsel Eaton.**
   - Prism Shield's start year = Edselâ€™s year - 2.

3. **"Criminal Bane" began his crusade in 2007.**
   - Criminal Bane = 2007

4. **"Ultra Hex" is Ned Nielsen.**
   - Therefore, the year associated with Ned Nielsen also corresponds to "Ultra Hex."

Combine the clues:

- Clue 3 clearly puts "Criminal Bane" starting in 2007.
- Ned Nielsen is "Ultra Hex", which constrains Ned's identity tightly with the superhero "Ultra Hex".

Let's assign realistic dates to eliminate possibilities:
- Since "Criminal Bane" started in 2007, Fred cannot have begun then, and Ned, being specified to start a year after Fred, shifts possibilities.
- Since "Prism Shield" starts 2 years before Edsel Eaton, the year must allow such a gap.

Assigning subsequent possible values:
- Put "Ultra Hex" (Ned Nielsen) at the next possible year: If we put Ned in 2009 and Fred is one year earlier, Fred begins in 2008. 
- That leaves "Prism Shield" for either 2008 or earlier, but since it begins 2 years before Edsel Eaton, and considering 2007 is taken by "Criminal Bane", if Edsel starts in 2010, "Prism Shield" starts in 2008.

At this point:
- Criminal Bane = 2007
- Prism Shield = 2008
- Ultra Hex/Ned Nielsen = 2009
- Fred begins in 2008 and cannot be Ned or Edsel (Fred's start year needs to allow another hero 2 years later), so Fred is not "Prism Shield" or "Ultra Hex". "Green Avenger" fits as it does not have a year conflict.
- Edsel, starting in 2010, cannot be any other years.

Final Solution:
- **Criminal Bane:** 2007, Edsel Eaton
- **Green Avenger:** 2008, Fred Fleming
- **Prism Shield:** 2009, Peter Powers
- **Ultra Hex:** 2010, Ned Nielsen

Thus the identities and careers fit logically with the information given.
