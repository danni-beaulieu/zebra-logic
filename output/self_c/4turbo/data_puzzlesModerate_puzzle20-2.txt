Attempt: 

From the second logic grid puzzle, let's extract and combine information from each clue:

1. **Clue:** "Of Cate Carlson and Bev Baird, one ended up with 9000 votes and the other is the teacher."
   - Cate Carlson and Bev Baird are either teacher or received 9000 votes.
   - Bev Baird could either receive 9000 votes or be the teacher.

2. **Clue:** "The academic finished 1000 votes behind Gilda Gray."
   - Academic received 1000 votes fewer than Gilda Gray.

3. **Clue:** "The four candidates were Bev Baird, the person who received 9000 votes, the architect and the candidate who received 8500 votes."
   - Bev Baird, 9000 votes, the architect, and the 8500 votes are four separate entities.

4. **Clue:** "Bev Baird was either the person who received 9500 votes or the politician who received 8500 votes."
   - Eliminates possibility of Bev Baird having 9000 votes.
   - Since Bev Baird is 8500 or 9500, and Bev is separate from the 9000 votes, it must be Cate Carlson who ended up with 9000 votes.
   - Hence, Bev Baird must be the teacher, since 9000 voter (Cate Carlson) can't also be the teacher.

Refinement from established rules:
- Gilda Gray cannot be the academic (she has more votes than the academic).
- Gilda Gray also cannot be the person with 8500 votes.
- If Gilda Gray is Cate Carlson, the 9000 votes entity is eliminated; since she must get more votes than the academic, and neither 8500 nor 9000 can support this rule, then Gilda Gray must get either 9500 or 10000 votes.

Further refinement:
- Gildaâ€™s higher number of votes could be 10000, meaning the academic got 9000 votes, but since Cate has 9000, she cannot be Gilda and the academic simultaneously.
- Gilda Gray has 9500 votes.

Matching the entities:
- The last standing candidate, Ida Ingram, must be either the architect or the academic, and with the confirmation of vote distribution among others, she has to be the architect.
- Cate Carlson, having 9000 votes and not being teacher implies she is the writer.
- The last profession and vote count (10000) go to the academic, left for the remaining candidate not allocated yet.

Final Arrangement:
- **Bev Baird** is the teacher with 8500 votes.
- **Cate Carlson** is the writer with 9000 votes.
- **Gilda Gray** has 9500 votes (cannot determine profession yet).
- **Ida Ingram** is the architect and, by process of elimination, the remaining academic role and 10000 votes go to the unnamed remaining candidate.

Since there is a missing clarity on who exactly is the academic, the direct assignment of some roles in this specific setup might need re-examination based on all the given clues and the clarity they offer.
