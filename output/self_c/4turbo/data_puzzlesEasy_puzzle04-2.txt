Attempt: 

For the second logic puzzle:

Entities:
- Prices: 550, 575, 600, 625
- Companies: Cober, Lirios, Nectron, Torvia
- Cameras: DM-5000, G-290, Tela G5, Zenix 2C

Clues:
1. The Tela G5 costs 25 dollars less than the model made by Nectron.
2. The camera made by Lirios is either the $625 camera or the DM-5000.
3. The camera made by Lirios costs 25 dollars less than the model made by Torvia.
4. The four cameras are the G-290, the $625 camera, the $550 camera and the model made by Lirios.

Steps and Solution:

1. **Clue 1:** Tela G5 is 25 dollars less than Nectron's model.
   - Nectron's prices: 575, 600, 625
   - Tela G5's prices: 550, 575, 600 

2. **Clue 2:** Lirios is either $625 or DM-5000.
   - Lirios: 625 or DM-5000.

3. **Clue 3:** Lirios’s price is 25 dollars less than Torvia’s price.
   - If Lirios is 625, Torvia is not possible as it would exceed available prices.
   - If Lirios is DM-5000 and fits in available prices: Lirios = 600, Torvia = 625.

4. **Clue 4:** The cameras are G-290, $625 camera, $550 camera, Lirios.
   - G-290 needs a different price from Lirios.
   - Based on prior clues and eliminations from price, if Lirios has DM-5000, it is 600, and Torvia is 625.
   - G-290 then can be 550 or 575.
   - Tela G5, from clue 1, fits remaining price slots left for Nectron's camera.

With Lirios implied as 600, this leaves:
- Lirios: DM-5000, 600
- Torvia: 625 with G-290 or Zenix 2C
- Nectron: higher than Tela G5 by 25 dollars. If Tela G5 is 575 (as it is the only remaining price for Nectron to be 600), Nectron is 600.
- Remaining camera for Cober: should be G-290 or Zenix 2C with the price 550.
- This leaves Torvia with Zenix 2C at 625, and Cober with G-290 at 550.

Final answer:

- Lirios, DM-5000, 600
- Torvia, Zenix 2C, 625
- Nectron, Tela G5, 575
- Cober, G-290, 550

This configuration adheres to all clues provided.
