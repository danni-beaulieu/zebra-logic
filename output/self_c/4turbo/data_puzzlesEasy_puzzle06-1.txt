Attempt: 

 for the second puzzle:**
- Z-Free XL, 20000 BTUs, (Remaining Price)
- Chiller Z, 25000 BTUs, (Remaining Price)
- Binson C40, $440, 5000 BTUs
- Freezon Flux, $570, (Remaining Capacity)
- $375 item, 10000 BTUs

Remaining prices and capacities to be positioned based on given relationships. Since $375 is less than the unit with 25000 BTUs, it aligns with 10000 BTUs being less priced than 25000 BTUs. Thus, Freezon Flux might be the 10000 BTUs as the only option left for the price and the 25000 BTUs goes with the remaining unit, likely the Z.
