Attempt: 

:
- Eagle Grove, 1350 sq ft, $1100/month
- La Palma, 1100 sq ft, $1525/month
- Monticello, 1475 sq ft, $1600/month
- Capitola, 1225 sq ft, $825/month

Review the answer above and adjust if necessary, as I realized logical inconsistency might arise with matching rents that were pre-assigned incorrectly in the process. Eagle Grove should be 1350 sq ft at $1100/month, Capitola should be 1225 sq ft at $1525/month according to clue alignment.
