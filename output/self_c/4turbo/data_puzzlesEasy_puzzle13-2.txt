Attempt: 

First, we gather and analyze the information given in the clues for the second puzzle regarding hedge funds, YTD returns, and managers:

1. "First Crescent is run by Kip Kerr."
- Kip Kerr manages First Crescent.

2. "Citizen Trust is either the one with a return of 7% or the fund run by Kip Kerr."
- Because Kip Kerr manages First Crescent, he cannot also manage Citizen Trust. So, Citizen Trust must have a return of 7%.

3. "The fund run by Ule Underwood has a 2 percent larger return than Hudson Brook."
- Let's denote Ule Underwood’s fund's return as U and Hudson Brook’s return as H such that U = H + 2%.

4. "The fund with a return of 7% is run by Walter Wade."
- Walter Wade manages Citizen Trust (from the information that Citizen Trust returns 7%).

To further deduce and solve:

- Since Ule Underwood's fund has 2% higher returns than Hudson Brook, and we know we have the return percentages of 6%, 7%, 8%, and 9%, we can figure from this clue:
   - If Hudson Brook had 6%, Ule Underwood's fund would have 8%.
   - If Hudson Brook had 7%, Ule Underwood's fund would have 9%. But Walter Wade manages Citizen Trust, which tabs the 7% return.

So, from this, let's assign:
- Hudson Brook: 6% return.
- Ule Underwood’s fund: 8% return.

Now, we have designated managers and funds for:
- Citizen Trust: 7% (Walter Wade)
- First Crescent: (unknown return since Kip Kerr cannot have 7% return, and since 8% is taken by Ule’s fund, possible returns are 6% or 9%)
- Hudson Brook has a 6% return (manager unknown).

Remaining entities:
- Oak Capital (remaining fund).
- Mike McClain (remaining manager).
- 9% (remaining return).

Therefore:
- Kip Kerr cannot manage the 7% return fund, and neither can Ule Underwood. Ule manages the fund with 8% return. Thus, the only remaining return for Kip Kerr's managed fund, First Crescent, must be 9%.
- This leaves Hudson Brook to be managed by Mike McClain (the remaining manager) with a return of 6%.
- And Oak Capital by default now is managed by Ule Underwood with an 8% return.

Solution:
- Kip Kerr, First Crescent, 9%
- Mike McClain, Hudson Brook, 6%
- Ule Underwood, Oak Capital, 8%
- Walter Wade, Citizen Trust, 7%
