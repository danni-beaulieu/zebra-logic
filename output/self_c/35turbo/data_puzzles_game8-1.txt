Attempt: 

From the clues:

1. Willie scored 181 points.
2. Evelyn scored somewhat higher than the dancer who performed seventh.
3. The dancer who performed eighth scored 3 points lower than the dancer who performed first.
4. The person who danced second scored somewhat lower than the person who danced seventh.
5. Natasha was either the person who danced second or the dancer who performed first.

Using clue 1, we know Willie scored 181 points.
Using clue 3, we know the dancer who performed eighth scored 178 points.
Using clue 5, we know Natasha either danced second or performed first.
Using clue 4, we know Natasha didn't dance second, so she must have performed first. Therefore, Natasha scored 190 points.
Using clue 3, the dancer who performed first scored 187 points.

From clue 2, Evelyn scored somewhat higher than the dancer who performed seventh. Since Natasha performed first and scored 190 points, Evelyn must have scored 187 points. Therefore, Natasha did not perform seventh, Melissa performed seventh and scored 184 points.

Therefore, the final solution is:

Evelyn, 187 points, first
Melissa, 184 points, seventh
Natasha, 190 points, eighth
Willie, 181 points, second
