To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's list out the information and use the clues to deduce the remaining associations:

Entities:
- Year: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
- Superheroes: Criminal Bane, Green Avenger, Prism Shield, Ultra Hex
- Real names: Edsel Eaton, Fred Fleming, Ned Nielsen, Peter Powers

Based on the clues:
1. Fred Fleming began 1 year before Ned Nielsen.
2. "Prism Shield" began 2 years before Edsel Eaton.
3. "Criminal Bane" began his crusade in 2007.
4. "Ultra Hex" is Ned Nielsen.

Steps:

- Right away from clue 3, we know Criminal Bane started in 2007.
- From clue 4, Ultra Hex is Ned Nielsen. 
- Fred Fleming began 1 year before Ned Nielsen (clue 1). If Ned as Ultra Hex began in year X, Fred must have begun in year X-1.
- Since clue 2 states Prism Shield began 2 years before Edsel Eaton, we need to fit Edsel Eaton into the timeline correctly.

Let's fill these out based on possible timelines:
- Since Criminal Bane started in 2007, and Ultra Hex is Ned Nielsen, Ultra Hex cannot start in 2007.
- Fred Fleming starts one year before Ned Nielsen; since Ned is Ultra Hex, let's place Ned at the latest possible year, given no other constraints:
  - If Ned (Ultra Hex) started in 2010, Fred would have begun in 2009.
  - If Ned (Ultra Hex) started in 2009, Fred would have begun in 2008. This plus the fact Prism Shield starts 2 years before Edsel is critical. Since Fred has to start before Ned, placing Ned in 2009 (as Ultra Hex) will allow Fred to be the superhero in 2008.

From the years already taken:
- 2007: Criminal Bane
- 2008: Fred Fleming
- 2009: Ned Nielsen (Ultra Hex)
- 2010: Left for the remaining superheroe and real name.

Matching the superheroes and real names not yet used:
- Edsel Eaton must be Prism Shield (as per clue 2).
- Peter Powers must be left for the remaining superhero â€” Green Avenger.

With all years and matching real names and superheroes:
- 2007: Criminal Bane, Edsel Eaton (since Prism Shield starts 2 years before Edsel, Edsel must begin latest possible year relative to Prism Shield)
- 2010: Prism Shield, Peter Powers (since Criminal Bane and Ultra Hex already matched and Edsel Eaton cannot be Prism Shield in 2010 due to clue 2)
- 2008: Green Avenger, Fred Fleming
- 2009: Ultra Hex, Ned Nielsen

Final answer:
2007: Criminal Bane, Edsel Eaton
2008: Green Avenger, Fred Fleming
2009: Ultra Hex, Ned Nielsen
2010: Prism Shield, Peter Powers

Grade:
