Attempt: 

:

Frederick, Orlando, 10:00am
Ira, Nelson, 12:00pm
Charlie, Karla, 11:00am
Harold, Sophie, 9:00am

Explanation:

1. From the clue that the person who will work with Nelson starts an hour after Ira, and the choices for Iraâ€™s start time are 9:00am, 10:00am, and 11:00am, Ira cannot start at 12:00pm.
2. Since the clue says that of the person whose assignment begins at 10:00am and Frederick, one will be working with Nelson and the other with Orlando, and since the person working with Nelson starts 1 hour after Ira, this implies that Frederick cannot be working with Nelson (since neither can start at 11:00am due to point 1). Thus, Frederick must be starting at 10:00am, working with Orlando.
3. From point 2, the person working with Nelson (who starts at 12:00pm due to the time slot available after Ira who cannot start at 12:00pm) must be the 10:00am assignment shifted. Hence, this person (not Frederick and not the 10:00am person) starting at 12:00pm must be Ira.
4. Using another clue, the interpreter whose assignment begins at 11:00am is either Ira or the one working with Karla; since we know Ira is at 12:00pm with Nelson, the 11:00am interpreter is the one working with Karla, thus this is not Ira. It must be, by elimination, Charlie.
5. The remaining time slot of 9:00am and person Sophie pairs with the final interpreter, Harold, since all other interpreters, times, and students have been matched.
