Attempt: 

:

Avery Bridge, suspension, 8500 ft  
North Bridge, girder, 10000 ft  
Gorem Bridge, truss, 13000 ft  
Bay Bridge, cantilever, 14500 ft  

Let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **North Bridge is the girder bridge.**
   - North Bridge: Girder

2. **Gorem Bridge is 3000 feet longer than the girder bridge.**
   - Since North Bridge is the girder bridge and the next increment from any known length should be 3000 ft higher, Gorem Bridge has to be 13000 ft (10000 ft + 3000 ft = 13000 ft).
   - Gorem Bridge: 13000 ft

3. **Of Avery Bridge and North Bridge, one is the suspension bridge and the other is 8500 ft.**
   - Since North Bridge is already identified as the girder bridge and not the suspension bridge, Avery Bridge must be the suspension bridge.
   - Avery Bridge: Suspension
   - Therefore, since North Bridge is not 8500 ft (as it would have been already stated), Avery Bridge must be 8500 ft.
   
4. **Gorem Bridge is 1500 feet shorter than Bay Bridge.**
   - Gorem Bridge is 13000 ft, so Bay Bridge must be 14500 ft (13000 ft + 1500 ft).

5. **The 11500 ft bridge is either the truss structure or Bay Bridge.**
   - Since Bay Bridge is 14500 ft, the 11500 ft cannot apply to Bay Bridge, which implies the 11500 ft bridge must be the truss structure.
   - There are no indications directly contradicting any other allocations.

Filling in remaining types and correlating lengths:
- Since the types and lengths align only one way confirmed by all clues: North Bridge, already identified as Girder, must be 10000 ft; Gorem Bridge being the truss, aligns with 13000 ft; Bay Bridge remains as Cantilever, therefore correlates with 14500 ft. 

All entities match with the provided clues without contradictions, and the lengths align from smallest to largest cohesively with the type and bridge identities.
